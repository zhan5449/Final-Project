Hi Richard,

I decided to take a risk and skip this part of the project, assuming my projects A and B were enough to get me a passing grade. I found the other two a bit more of a challenge and I do feel somewhat confident about machine learning having invested so much time in the SIOP ML competition. 
Thanks for a great course! I think if I had taken it when I first started to learn R, it could have saved me two whole years of blind googling.
